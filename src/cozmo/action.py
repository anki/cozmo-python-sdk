'''
Actions encapsulate specific high-level tasks that the Cozmo robot can perform.
They have a definite beginning and end.

These tasks include picking up an object, rotating in place, saying text, etc.

Actions are usually triggered by a call to a method on the
:class:`cozmo.robot.Robot` class such as :meth:`~cozmo.robot.Robot.turn_in_place`

The call will return an object that subclasses :class:`Action` that can be
used to cancel the action, or be observed to wait or be notified when the
action completes (or fails) by calling its
:meth:`~cozmo.event.Dispatcher.wait_for` or
:meth:`~cozmo.event.Dispatcher.add_event_handler` methods.


Warning:
    Unless you pass ``in_parallel=True`` when starting the action, no other
    action can be active at the same time.  Attempting to trigger a non-parallel
    action when another action is already in progress will result in a
    :class:`~cozmo.exceptions.RobotBusy` exception being raised.

    When using ``in_parallel=True`` you may see an action fail with the result
    :attr:`ActionResults.TRACKS_LOCKED` - this indicates that another in-progress
    action has already locked that movement track (e.g. two actions cannot
    move the head at the same time).
