'''Object and Power Cube recognition.

Cozmo can recognize and track a number of different types of objects.

These objects may be visible (currently observed by the robot's camera)
and tappable (in the case of the Power Cubes that ship with the robot).

Power Cubes are known as a :class:`LightCube` by the SDK.  Each cube has
controllable lights, and sensors that can determine when its being moved
or tapped.

Objects can emit several events such as :class:`EvtObjectObserved` when
the robot sees (or continues to see) the object with its camera, or
:class:`EvtObjectTapped` if a power cube is tapped by a player.  You
can either observe the object's instance directly, or capture all such events
for all objects by observing them on :class:`cozmo.world.World` instead.

All observable objects have a marker attached to them, which allows Cozmo
to recognize the object and it's position and rotation("pose").  You can attach
markers to your own objects for Cozmo to recognize by printing them out from the
online documentation.  They will be detected as :class:`CustomObject` instances.
