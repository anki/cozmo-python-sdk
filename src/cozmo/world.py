'''The "world" represents the robot's known view of its environment.

This view includes objects, faces and pets it knows about and can currently
"see" with its camera, along with what actions or behaviors the robot is
current performing and the images coming back from the camera (if any).

Almost all events emitted by the robot itself, objects, faces, pets and the
camera can be observed directly on the :class:`World` object, which is
itself accessible as :attr:`cozmo.robot.Robot.world`.

For example, if you only need to know whether a particular cube has been
tapped, you can call the :meth:`~cozmo.event.Dispatcher.wait_for` method
directly on that cube's :class:`cozmo.objects.LightCube` instance.  Eg::

    my_cube.wait_for(cozmo.objects.EvtObjectTapped)

If, however, you want to wait for any cube to be tapped, you could instead
call the :meth:`~cozmo.event.Dispatcher.wait_for` method on the
:class:`World` object instead.  Eg::

    robot.world.wait_for(cozmo.objects.EvtObjectTapped)

In either case, ``wait_for`` will return the instance of the event's
:class:`~cozmo.objects.EvtObjectTapped` class, which includes a
:attr:`~cozmo.objects.EvtObjectTapped.obj` attribute, which identifies
exactly which cube has been tapped.

The :class:`World` object also has a :class:`cozmo.camera.Camera` instance
associated with it.  It emits :class:`EvtNewCameraImage` objects whenever
a new camera image is available (generally up to 15 times per second),
which includes the raw image from the camera, as well as an annotated version
showing where faces, pets and objects have been observed.

.. Note::  The camera must first be enabled to receive images by setting
    :attr:`~cozmo.camera.Camera.image_stream_enabled` to ``True``.
