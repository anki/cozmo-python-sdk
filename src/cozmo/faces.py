'''Face recognition and enrollment.

Cozmo is capable of recognizing human faces, tracking their position and rotation
("pose") and assigning names to them via an enrollment process.

The :class:`cozmo.world.World` object keeps track of faces the robot currently
knows about, along with those that are currently visible to the camera.

Each face is assigned a :class:`Face` object, which generates a number of
observable events whenever the face is observed, has its ID updated, is
renamed, etc.

Note that these face-specific events are also passed up to the
:class:`cozmo.world.World` object, so events for all known faces can be
observed by adding handlers there.
