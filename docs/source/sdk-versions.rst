SDK vs. App Versions
####################

The Cozmo SDK is updated often in order to provide you with the best possible user experience. The SDK and Cozmo app do not always update at the same frequency. Check this list to see if the version of the SDK you wish to use matches up with the version of the app you are using.

+---------------+---------------+
| App Version # | SDK Version # |
+===============+===============+
| 1.0.1         | 0.7.0         |
+---------------+---------------+
| 1.0.2         | 0.8.0         |
+---------------+---------------+

If you have incompatible versions of the app and the SDK, please update the app and SDK.
