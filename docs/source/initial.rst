^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Failure to Install Python Package

If your attempt to install Python packages such as NumPy fails, please upgrade your pip install as follows:

    On macOS and Linux::

        pip3 install -U pip

    On Windows::

        py -3 -m pip install -U pip

    Once the pip command is upgraded, retry your Python package installation.
