Python Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the `Python 3.5.1 (or later) executable file from Python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and
run it on your computer.

.. important:: We recommend that you tick the "Add Python 3.5 to PATH" checkbox on the Setup screen.

To install the SDK, type the following into the Command Prompt window::

    pip3 install --user cozmo[camera]

Note that the [camera] option adds support for processing images from Cozmo's camera.

"""""""""""
SDK Upgrade
"""""""""""

To upgrade the SDK from a previous install, enter this command::

    pip3 install --user --upgrade cozmo

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mobile Device Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **iOS** devices require `iTunes <http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/>`_ to ensure that the usbmuxd service is installed on your computer. Usbmuxd is required for the computer to communicate with the iOS device over a USB cable. While iTunes needs to be installed, it does not need to be running.

* **Android** devices require installation of :ref:`adb` (adb) in order to run the Cozmo SDK. This is required for the computer to communicate with the Android mobile device over a USB cable and runs automatically when required.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please see the :ref:`trouble` section of the Initial Setup page for tips, or visit the `Cozmo SDK Forums <https://forums.anki.com/>`_ to ask questions, find solutions, or for general discussion.
