    pip3 install --user --upgrade cozmo

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mobile Device Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **iOS** devices require `iTunes <http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/>`_ to ensure that the usbmuxd service is installed on your computer. Usbmuxd is required for the computer to communicate with the iOS device over a USB cable. While iTunes needs to be installed, it does not need to be running.

* **Android** devices require installation of :ref:`adb` (adb) in order to run the Cozmo SDK. This is required for the computer to communicate with the Android mobile device over a USB cable and runs automatically when required.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please see the :ref:`trouble` section of the Initial Setup page for tips, or visit the `Cozmo SDK Forums <https://forums.anki.com/>`_ to ask questions, find solutions, or for general discussion.
