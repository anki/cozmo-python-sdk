'''Play some animations on Cozmo

Play an animation using a trigger, and then another animation by name.

    # http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/generated/cozmo.anim.html#cozmo.anim.Triggers
    # for a list of available triggers.
    # A trigger can pick from several appropriate animations for variety.

    # for other available settings.

    # Warning: Future versions of the app might change these, so for future-proofing
    # we recommend using play_anim_trigger above instead.

    # the available animations.
