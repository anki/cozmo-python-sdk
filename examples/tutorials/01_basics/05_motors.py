'''Drive Cozmo's motors directly

This is an example of how you can also have low-level control of Cozmo's motors
(wheels, lift and head) for fine-grained control and ease of controlling
multiple things at once.
'''

import sys
import time

import cozmo


def run(sdk_conn):
    '''The run method runs once Cozmo is connected.'''
    robot = sdk_conn.wait_for_robot()

    # Tell the head motor to start lowering the head (at 5 radians per second)
    robot.move_head(-5)
    # Tell the lift motor to start lowering the lift (at 5 radians per second)
    robot.move_lift(-5)
    # Tell Cozmo to drive the left wheel at 25 mmps (millimeters per second),
    # and the right wheel at 50 mmps (so Cozmo will drive Forwards whilst also
    # turning to the left
    robot.drive_wheels(25, 50)

    # wait for 3 seconds
    time.sleep(3)

    # Tell the head motor to start raising the head (at 5 radians per second)
    robot.move_head(5)
    # Tell the lift motor to start raising the lift (at 5 radians per second)
    robot.move_lift(5)
    # Tell Cozmo to drive the left wheel at 50 mmps (millimeters per second),
    # and the right wheel at -50 mmps (so Cozmo will turn on the spot to the right)
    robot.drive_wheels(50, -50)

    # wait for 3 seconds
    time.sleep(3)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    cozmo.setup_basic_logging()
    try:
        cozmo.connect(run)
    except cozmo.ConnectionError as e:
        sys.exit("A connection error occurred: %s" % e)
